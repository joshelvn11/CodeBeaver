Here's a markdown table that lists common ES7 (ECMAScript 2016) snippets that developers might use frequently in their coding, especially if they are using editors like Visual Studio Code which support snippet extensions.

These snippets help speed up development by providing quick templates for common JavaScript syntax and structure, making it easier to write and manage code.
