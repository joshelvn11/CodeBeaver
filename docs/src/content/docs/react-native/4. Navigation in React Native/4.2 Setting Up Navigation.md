title: 4.2 Setting Up Navigation
---

Setting up navigation in a React Native application using React Navigation involves installing necessary dependencies, configuring your navigators, and integrating them into your app. This section will guide you through the process step-by-step.

## 4.2.1 Installing React Navigation

To get started, you need to install React Navigation and its dependencies. Ensure you have already created your Expo project before proceeding.

### Step 1: Install Core Dependencies

Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to install the core library:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native
```

### Step 2: Install Stack Navigator

For most applications, you’ll want to use a stack navigator. Install the stack navigator library with:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/stack
```

### Step 3: Install Required Peer Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary peer dependencies for React Navigation:

```bash
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```

## 4.2.2 Setting Up Navigation Container

The `NavigationContainer` component is crucial as it manages the navigation state of your app. You need to wrap your main application in this component.

### Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import HomeScreen from './HomeScreen';
import DetailsScreen from './DetailsScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## 4.2.3 Creating Screens

Each screen in your app will be a separate component. Here’s how to create a simple `HomeScreen` and `DetailsScreen`.

### HomeScreen Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```

### DetailsScreen Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const DetailsScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Details Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default DetailsScreen;
```

## 4.2.4 Navigating Between Screens

To navigate between screens, you can use the `navigation` prop provided by React Navigation. This prop allows you to call functions like `navigate` to transition to a different screen.

### Example:

In the `HomeScreen`, you can navigate to the `DetailsScreen` using:

```javascript
<Button
  title="Go to Details"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
/>
```

## 4.2.5 Summary of Key Points

- **Installation**: Install the core React Navigation library and necessary dependencies for navigation.
- **Navigation Container**: Wrap your app with `NavigationContainer` to manage navigation state.
- **Creating Screens**: Define separate components for each screen in your application.
- **Navigating**: Use the `navigation` prop to move between screens using methods like `navigate`.

By following these steps, you can successfully set up navigation in your React Native application, allowing for smooth transitions between different screens and a better user experience.
