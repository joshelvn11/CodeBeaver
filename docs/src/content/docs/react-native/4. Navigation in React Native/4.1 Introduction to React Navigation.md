title: 4.1 Introduction to React Navigation
---

React Navigation is a powerful library that enables routing and navigation in React Native applications. It allows you to create a seamless navigation experience, enabling users to move between different screens and views in your app. Understanding how to set up and use React Navigation is essential for any React Native developer.

## 4.1.1 What is React Navigation?

React Navigation provides a set of navigators that can be used to implement various navigation patterns, such as stack, tab, and drawer navigation. It helps in managing the navigation state and rendering the correct screens based on user actions.

### Key Features:

- **Flexible**: Supports various navigation patterns to suit different app designs.
- **Customizable**: Allows for deep customization of transitions and appearance.
- **State Management**: Manages the navigation state and provides easy access to navigation actions.

## 4.1.2 Installing React Navigation

To get started with React Navigation, you need to install the library and its dependencies. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Core Dependencies

Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run the following command:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native
```

### Step 2: Install Additional Dependencies

Depending on the type of navigation you want to implement, you may need to install additional packages. For example, for stack navigation, run:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/stack
```

### Step 3: Install Required Peer Dependencies

React Navigation requires certain peer dependencies, which you can install with:

```bash
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```

## 4.1.3 Setting Up Navigation Container

The navigation container is a component that manages your app's navigation state. You need to wrap your application in a `NavigationContainer` to enable navigation.

### Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import HomeScreen from './HomeScreen';
import DetailsScreen from './DetailsScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## 4.1.4 Navigating Between Screens

You can navigate between screens using the `navigation` prop that is automatically passed to your screen components.

### Example:

In your `HomeScreen` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```

In your `DetailsScreen` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const DetailsScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Details Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default DetailsScreen;
```

## 4.1.5 Summary of Key Points

- **React Navigation**: A library that simplifies routing and navigation in React Native apps.
- **Installation**: Install core and stack navigator packages to get started.
- **Navigation Container**: Wrap your app with `NavigationContainer` to manage navigation state.
- **Navigating**: Use the `navigation` prop to move between screens.

By understanding and implementing React Navigation, you can create intuitive navigation flows that enhance the user experience in your React Native applications.
