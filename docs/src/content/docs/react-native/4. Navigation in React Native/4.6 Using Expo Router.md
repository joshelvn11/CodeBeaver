title: 4.6 Using Expo Router
---

Expo Router is a powerful tool for managing navigation in your React Native applications built with Expo. It provides an intuitive and flexible way to define routes and navigate between screens using file-based routing. This section will guide you through the basics of using Expo Router.

## 4.6.1 What is Expo Router?

Expo Router simplifies the navigation process by using the file system to manage routes. Instead of configuring routes programmatically, you can define your screens and their navigation structure through the file hierarchy, making it easier to manage and understand.

### Key Features:

- **File-Based Routing**: Create routes by organizing your files in the project directory.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Easily handle dynamic routes based on the file structure.
- **Nested Navigation**: Support for nested navigators to create complex navigation flows.

## 4.6.2 Setting Up Expo Router

### Step 1: Install Expo Router

First, ensure you have Expo Router installed in your Expo project. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm install expo-router
```

### Step 2: Configure Your App

Wrap your application in the `ExpoRouter` component, which will manage the navigation.

### Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { ExpoRouter } from 'expo-router';

const App = () => {
  return <ExpoRouter />;
};

export default App;
```

## 4.6.3 Creating Screens and Routes

You can create screens by simply adding files to the `app` directory. The file name will determine the route.

### Example Directory Structure:

```
/app
  ├── index.js         // Home screen
  ├── details.js       // Details screen
  └── settings.js      // Settings screen
```

### Home Screen (`index.js`):

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('details')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```

### Details Screen (`details.js`):

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const DetailsScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Details Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default DetailsScreen;
```

## 4.6.4 Navigating Between Screens

To navigate between screens, use the `navigation` prop available in your screen components. You can call the `navigate` method to move to the desired route.

### Example:

In the `HomeScreen`, you navigate to the `DetailsScreen` like this:

```javascript
<Button
  title="Go to Details"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('details')}
/>
```

## 4.6.5 Summary of Key Points

- **Expo Router**: A file-based routing system that simplifies navigation in Expo apps.
- **Installation**: Install `expo-router` to get started.
- **File Structure**: Create screens in the `app` directory to automatically define routes.
- **Navigation**: Use the `navigation` prop to navigate between screens.

By utilizing Expo Router, you can streamline the navigation process in your React Native applications, making it easier to manage and understand your app's routing structure. This approach enhances maintainability and reduces boilerplate code associated with navigation setup.
