title: 4.3 Stack Navigator
---

The Stack Navigator is a fundamental navigation pattern in React Navigation that allows you to transition between screens in a stack-like manner. Each new screen is pushed onto the stack, and users can navigate back by popping screens off the stack. This section will guide you through setting up and using a Stack Navigator in your React Native application.

## 4.3.1 What is a Stack Navigator?

A Stack Navigator manages a stack of screens where only one screen is visible at a time. When navigating to a new screen, the previous screen is pushed onto the stack, and when going back, the current screen is popped off the stack.

### Key Features:

- **Screen Transitions**: Smooth transitions between screens, allowing users to move back and forth.
- **Header Management**: Automatically provides a header for navigating back to previous screens.

## 4.3.2 Setting Up a Stack Navigator

### Step 1: Create the Stack Navigator

First, ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies. Then, create a Stack Navigator in your app.

### Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import HomeScreen from './HomeScreen';
import DetailsScreen from './DetailsScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
        <Stack.Screen 
          name="Home" 
          component={HomeScreen} 
          options={{ title: 'Home' }} 
        />
        <Stack.Screen 
          name="Details" 
          component={DetailsScreen} 
          options={{ title: 'Details' }} 
        />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## 4.3.3 Creating Screens

You need to create separate components for each screen. Below are examples of `HomeScreen` and `DetailsScreen`.

### HomeScreen Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```

### DetailsScreen Example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const DetailsScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Details Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default DetailsScreen;
```

## 4.3.4 Navigating Between Screens

To navigate between screens, use the `navigation` prop passed to your screen components. You can call the `navigate` method to move to a different screen.

### Example:

In `HomeScreen`, you can navigate to `DetailsScreen` like this:

```javascript
<Button
  title="Go to Details"
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
/>
```

## 4.3.5 Customizing Header Options

You can customize the header for each screen using the `options` prop in the `Stack.Screen` component.

### Example:

```javascript
<Stack.Screen 
  name="Details" 
  component={DetailsScreen} 
  options={{ title: 'Detail View', headerStyle: { backgroundColor: '#f4511e' }, headerTintColor: '#fff' }} 
/>
```

## 4.3.6 Summary of Key Points

- **Stack Navigator**: A navigation pattern that allows users to navigate between screens in a stack-like manner.
- **Installation**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies for React Navigation and the stack navigator.
- **Setting Up**: Use `createStackNavigator` to set up the navigator and wrap your app with `NavigationContainer`.
- **Navigation**: Use the `navigation` prop to navigate between screens.
- **Customizing Headers**: You can customize the header for each screen using the `options` prop.

By implementing the Stack Navigator, you can create a smooth navigation experience in your React Native application, allowing users to easily move between different screens.
