title: 2.3 Using the Expo Go App for Testing
---

The Expo Go app is a powerful tool for testing your React Native applications quickly and efficiently. It allows you to run your app on a physical device or an emulator, giving you instant feedback as you develop. This section will guide you through the process of using the Expo Go app for testing your applications.

## 2.3.1 Installing the Expo Go App

To get started, you need to install the Expo Go app on your mobile device. Follow these steps:

### For iOS

1. Open the App Store on your iOS device.
2. Search for "Expo Go."
3. Download and install the app.

### For Android

1. Open the Google Play Store on your Android device.
2. Search for "Expo Go."
3. Download and install the app.

## 2.3.2 Starting Your Expo Project

Before you can test your app, ensure that your Expo project is running. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Start the Expo development server with the following command:

```bash
expo start
```

This command will start the server and open a new tab in your default web browser, displaying the Expo development dashboard.

## 2.3.3 Connecting Your Device

To test your app using the Expo Go app, you'll need to connect your mobile device to the same Wi-Fi network as your development machine. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device.
2. Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or in the Expo development dashboard. You can use the camera or the built-in QR code scanner in the Expo Go app.
3. Your app will load in the Expo Go app, allowing you to interact with it on your device.

## 2.3.4 Hot Reloading

One of the key features of Expo is hot reloading, which enables you to see changes in your app immediately without needing to rebuild it. 

- As you make changes to your code and save the file, the Expo Go app will automatically refresh to reflect those changes.

### Example: Modifying Your App

1. Open the `App.js` file in your code editor.
2. Change the text from "Welcome to My First React Native App!" to "Hello, Expo Go!".
3. Save the file.

You will see the text change in the Expo Go app without needing to restart the app.

## 2.3.5 Debugging Your App

Expo Go also provides tools for debugging your application:

1. **Console Logs**: Use `console.log` statements in your code to output information to the terminal. You can view these logs in the terminal where you started your Expo server.
2. **React Developer Tools**: You can use the React Developer Tools extension in your web browser to inspect the component hierarchy and state of your application.

## 2.3.6 Using Device Features

With Expo Go, you can test your app's use of device features such as:

- **Camera**: Access the device camera and test image capturing.
- **Location Services**: Use GPS to test location-based features.
- **Notifications**: Send push notifications to see how they behave.

## 2.3.7 Summary of Key Points

- **Install Expo Go**: Download and install the Expo Go app from the App Store or Google Play Store.
- **Start Your Project**: Run your Expo project using `expo start` to launch the development server.
- **Connect Your Device**: Ensure your device is on the same Wi-Fi network and scan the QR code to load your app.
- **Hot Reloading**: Enjoy real-time updates as you modify your code, thanks to hot reloading.
- **Debugging Tools**: Utilize console logs and React Developer Tools for debugging your app.
- **Test Device Features**: Explore your appâ€™s functionality with access to device features.

By using the Expo Go app, you can streamline your testing process and enhance your development workflow, making it easier to create robust React Native applications.
