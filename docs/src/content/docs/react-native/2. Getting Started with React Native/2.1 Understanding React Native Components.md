title: 2.1 Understanding React Native Components
---

React Native components are the building blocks of your application. They are reusable, encapsulated pieces of code that render UI elements and handle user interactions. Understanding how to use and create components is essential for developing React Native apps.

## 2.1.1 What are Components?

Components in React Native are JavaScript functions or classes that return a React element. They can accept inputs, called "props," and manage their own internal state. Components can be classified into two main types: **Functional Components** and **Class Components**.

### Functional Components

Functional components are simpler and are defined as JavaScript functions. They can accept props and return React elements.

#### Example:
```javascript
const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <Text>Hello, {name}!</Text>;
};
```

### Class Components

Class components are more complex and are defined using ES6 class syntax. They can maintain their own state and have lifecycle methods.

#### Example:
```javascript
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Text>Hello, {this.props.name}!</Text>;
  }
}
```

## 2.1.2 Why Use Components?

Using components offers several advantages:

- **Reusability**: You can reuse components throughout your app, reducing code duplication.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Components help you organize your code by separating different parts of your UI and logic.
- **Maintainability**: Smaller components are easier to manage, test, and debug.

## 2.1.3 Creating Your First Component

To create a component in React Native, follow these steps:

1. **Import React and Necessary Libraries**: You need to import React and any other libraries or components you will use.
2. **Define Your Component**: Use either a functional or class component.
3. **Export Your Component**: Make sure to export your component so it can be used in other parts of your application.

### Example of a Functional Component:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const Welcome = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Welcome;
```

## 2.1.4 Props: Passing Data to Components

Props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from one component to another. They are read-only and should not be modified by the child component.

### Example:
```javascript
const Welcome = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome, {name}!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

// Usage
<Welcome name="John" />
```

In this example, the `name` prop is passed to the `Welcome` component, allowing it to render a personalized message.

## 2.1.5 State: Managing Component Data

State is used to manage data that changes over time within a component. Class components have a built-in state object, while functional components can use the `useState` hook.

### Using State in Class Components:
```javascript
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Count: {this.state.count}</Text>
        <Button title="Increment" onPress={this.increment} />
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

### Using State in Functional Components:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, Button, View } from 'react-native';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

## 2.1.6 Component Lifecycle (Class Components)

Class components have lifecycle methods that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life. Some important lifecycle methods include:

- `componentDidMount`: Called after the component is mounted.
- `componentDidUpdate`: Called after the component updates.
- `componentWillUnmount`: Called just before the component is unmounted.

### Example:
```javascript
class Timer extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Start timer
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Cleanup timer
  }
}
```

## 2.1.7 Summary of Key Points

- **Components** are the fundamental building blocks of React Native apps, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- **Functional and Class Components** serve different purposes, with functional components being simpler and class components offering lifecycle methods and state management.
- **Props** allow you to pass data between components, while **State** is used to manage data within a component.
- Understanding the lifecycle of class components is crucial for handling resources and side effects in your application.

By mastering components, you will be well on your way to building efficient and organized React Native applications.
