title: 2.4 Exploring the Project Structure
---

When you create a new React Native project using Expo, it comes with a predefined structure that organizes your code and assets effectively. Understanding this structure is essential for navigating your project and managing its components. This section will guide you through the key directories and files in your Expo project.

## 2.4.1 Overview of the Project Structure

After running the command to create a new Expo project, you’ll see a structure similar to the following:

```
MyFirstApp/
├── assets/
├── node_modules/
├── App.js
├── app.json
├── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

### Key Components:

- **`assets/`**: This directory contains images, fonts, and other static assets used in your application. You can organize your assets into subfolders for better organization.

- **`node_modules/`**: This folder contains all the packages and dependencies installed via npm or yarn. You generally do not modify files in this directory directly.

- **`App.js`**: This is the main entry point of your application. It is where you define your root component and render your app's UI. You’ll spend a lot of time working in this file.

- **`app.json`**: This file contains configuration options for your app, such as its name, icon, and version. It also specifies settings for building and deploying your app.

- **`package.json`**: This file contains metadata about your project, including its dependencies, scripts, and other configurations. You can add or modify dependencies in this file.

- **`yarn.lock`**: If you use Yarn as your package manager, this file locks the versions of your dependencies to ensure consistent installs across different environments.

## 2.4.2 Understanding App.js

The `App.js` file is crucial as it serves as the starting point for your app. Here’s a closer look at its structure:

### Basic Example of App.js

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Welcome to My First React Native App!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **Imports**: You import React and necessary components from `react-native`.
- **Function Component**: The `App` function is a functional component that returns a React element.
- **JSX**: You use JSX syntax to define the UI structure, which makes it intuitive to visualize the layout.

## 2.4.3 Managing Assets

### Adding Images

To use images in your app, place them in the `assets/` folder. You can then import and use them in your components:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Image, View } from 'react-native';
import logo from './assets/logo.png'; // Importing an image

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Image source={logo} style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## 2.4.4 Modifying app.json

The `app.json` file allows you to configure your app’s settings. Here’s a sample configuration:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "MyFirstApp",
    "slug": "myfirstapp",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    },
    "updates": {
      "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
    },
    "assetBundlePatterns": ["**/*"]
  }
}
```

### Key Properties:

- **`name`**: The name of your app as it appears on the device.
- **`slug`**: A URL-friendly version of your app name.
- **`icon`**: Path to the app icon.
- **`splash`**: Configuration for the splash screen displayed during app loading.

## 2.4.5 Understanding package.json

The `package.json` file provides essential information about your project and its dependencies. Here's an example snippet:

```json
{
  "name": "MyFirstApp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "~45.0.0",
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "17.0.2",
    "react-native": "0.68.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-preset-expo": "~8.4.1"
  }
}
```

### Important Sections:

- **`dependencies`**: Lists the packages your app requires to run.
- **`devDependencies`**: Lists packages needed only for development purposes, like build tools and linters.

## 2.4.6 Summary of Key Points

- **Project Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the directories and files created in your Expo project.
- **App.js**: This is the main entry point for your app where you define your root component.
- **Assets**: Store and manage your static assets in the `assets/` directory.
- **Configuration Files**: Use `app.json` for app settings and `package.json` for managing dependencies.

By understanding the project structure, you'll be better equipped to navigate and build your React Native applications effectively.
