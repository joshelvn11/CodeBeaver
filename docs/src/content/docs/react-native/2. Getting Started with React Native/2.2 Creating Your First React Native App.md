title: 2.2 Creating Your First React Native App
---

Creating your first React Native app is an exciting step toward building mobile applications. This section will guide you through the process of setting up your environment and creating a simple app using Expo.

## 2.2.1 Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start building your app, you need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps:

### 1. Install Node.js

Node.js is required to run the Expo CLI. Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Install Expo CLI

Expo CLI is a command-line tool that helps you create and manage your React Native projects. You can install it globally using npm (Node Package Manager) with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### 3. Install a Code Editor

Choose a code editor to write your React Native code. Popular options include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

## 2.2.2 Creating a New Expo Project

Once your environment is set up, you can create a new Expo project. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a New Project

Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `MyFirstApp` with your desired project name:

```bash
expo init MyFirstApp
```

### Step 2: Choose a Template

You will be prompted to choose a template. Select the "blank" template for a simple start.

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Change into your project directory with:

```bash
cd MyFirstApp
```

## 2.2.3 Running Your App

To see your app in action, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
expo start
```

This will start the Expo development server and open a new tab in your browser. You will see a QR code that you can scan with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to view your app.

### Using the Expo Go App

1. Download the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/client) from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android).
2. Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code displayed in your terminal or browser.
3. Your app will load on your device, allowing you to see changes in real-time.

## 2.2.4 Editing Your App

Now that your app is running, you can start editing it. Open the `App.js` file in your code editor. This file is the main entry point for your application.

### Example: Modifying the App

Replace the default code in `App.js` with the following:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Welcome to My First React Native App!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },
});
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Import Statements**: You import necessary components from React and React Native.
- **App Component**: The `App` function returns a `View` containing a `Text` element.
- **Styles**: The `StyleSheet` is used to style the components.

## 2.2.5 Live Reloading

One of the great features of Expo is live reloading. As you make changes to your code and save the file, the app will automatically refresh, allowing you to see your updates in real-time.

## 2.2.6 Summary of Key Points

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure Node.js and Expo CLI are installed to create and run React Native apps.
- **Creating a Project**: Use `expo init` to create a new Expo project and navigate to its directory.
- **Running the App**: Use `expo start` to run your app and view it on your mobile device using the Expo Go app.
- **Editing Your App**: Modify the `App.js` file to customize your app's UI and functionality.
- **Live Reloading**: Enjoy instant feedback as you develop your app with live reloading features.

By following these steps, you have successfully created your first React Native app using Expo!
