title: 5.1 Understanding Interfaces
---

Interfaces are one of TypeScriptâ€™s core features, offering a powerful way to define the shape and structure of objects. They help in establishing contracts within your code, allowing you to define expected properties and types, promoting strong type checking.

## 5.1.1 What is an Interface?

An interface in TypeScript is a way to define the structure of an object, including its properties and their types, without specifying implementation details. Interfaces can describe not only objects but also functions, arrays, and classes.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
interface InterfaceName {
  propertyName: type;
  methodName(param: type): returnType;
}
```

#### Example:
```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  greet(): string;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};

console.log(user.greet()); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice.
```

In this example, the `User` interface defines the structure for a user object with `name`, `age`, and a `greet` method. Any object that adheres to this interface will need to include these properties.

## 5.1.2 Benefits of Using Interfaces

Interfaces in TypeScript bring several benefits, including:

- **Type Safety**: Interfaces enforce that an object or class matches a specific structure, preventing errors from missing or incorrectly typed properties.
- **Code Readability**: By using interfaces, you can explicitly define what is expected in an object or class, making your code easier to understand.
- **Reusability**: Interfaces can be reused across different parts of your codebase, ensuring consistent structure and reducing duplication.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Car {
  model: string;
  year: number;
  start(): void;
}

const myCar: Car = {
  model: "Toyota",
  year: 2020,
  start() {
    console.log(`${this.model} is starting.`);
  }
};

myCar.start(); // Outputs: Toyota is starting.
```

Here, the `Car` interface ensures that any object representing a car must have a `model`, `year`, and a `start` method, promoting consistency.

## 5.1.3 Optional Properties

In TypeScript interfaces, you can specify optional properties by adding a question mark (`?`) after the property name. This means that objects implementing the interface may or may not have these properties.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Employee {
  name: string;
  department?: string;  // Optional
}

const emp1: Employee = { name: "John" };
const emp2: Employee = { name: "Jane", department: "Finance" };

console.log(emp1.name);        // Outputs: John
console.log(emp2.department);  // Outputs: Finance
```

In this example, `department` is optional, allowing the object `emp1` to omit it while `emp2` includes it.

## 5.1.4 Readonly Properties

You can use the `readonly` keyword to prevent properties from being modified after they are initialized. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that certain properties remain immutable.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Book {
  readonly title: string;
  author: string;
}

const myBook: Book = {
  title: "The Great Gatsby",
  author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald"
};

// myBook.title = "New Title"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'title' because it is a read-only property.
myBook.author = "New Author";  // Works
```

In this case, the `title` property is marked as `readonly`, preventing it from being changed after initialization.

## 5.1.5 Function Interfaces

Interfaces can also describe the shape of a function, including its parameters and return type.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Calculator {
  (x: number, y: number): number;
}

const add: Calculator = (x, y) => x + y;
const multiply: Calculator = (x, y) => x * y;

console.log(add(5, 3));       // Outputs: 8
console.log(multiply(4, 3));  // Outputs: 12
```

Here, the `Calculator` interface defines a function signature with two `number` parameters and a `number` return type. The functions `add` and `multiply` conform to this signature.

## 5.1.6 Extending Interfaces

One of TypeScript's powerful features is the ability to extend interfaces. This allows you to create new interfaces by building upon existing ones, adding additional properties.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

const myDog: Dog = {
  name: "Buddy",
  breed: "Golden Retriever"
};

console.log(myDog.name);   // Outputs: Buddy
console.log(myDog.breed);  // Outputs: Golden Retriever
```

In this example, the `Dog` interface extends the `Animal` interface, inheriting its `name` property and adding a new `breed` property.

## 5.1.7 Key Points

- **Defining Structure**: Interfaces provide a way to define the structure of objects, functions, arrays, and classes in TypeScript.
- **Optional and Readonly Properties**: You can mark properties as optional or readonly, adding flexibility and control to your interfaces.
- **Reusability and Extensibility**: Interfaces can be reused across your codebase and extended to create more specific types.

By using interfaces, you ensure your code is well-structured, type-safe, and maintainable, making it easier to scale and manage large TypeScript projects.
