title: 5.2 Implementing Interfaces
---

In TypeScript, interfaces define the structure of objects, and classes or objects can implement these interfaces to ensure they adhere to the defined contract. Implementing interfaces provides strong typing, helping developers ensure that the necessary properties and methods are included, leading to more robust code.

## 5.2.1 What Does "Implementing an Interface" Mean?

When a class implements an interface, it means the class agrees to provide all the properties and methods specified by the interface. This helps enforce consistency and provides a clear structure for objects.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
interface InterfaceName {
  propertyName: type;
  methodName(param: type): returnType;
}

class ClassName implements InterfaceName {
  propertyName: type;
  methodName(param: type): returnType {
    // method body
  }
}
```

#### Example:
```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  greet(): string;
}

class Employee implements Person {
  name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet(): string {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
}

const emp = new Employee("John");
console.log(emp.greet()); // Outputs: Hello, my name is John.
```

In this example, the `Employee` class implements the `Person` interface, ensuring that it contains a `name` property and a `greet` method, fulfilling the contract defined by the interface.

## 5.2.2 Implementing Multiple Interfaces

TypeScript allows classes to implement multiple interfaces, combining several contracts into one. This is useful when a class needs to adhere to multiple behaviors or structures.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Drivable {
  drive(): void;
}

interface Flyable {
  fly(): void;
}

class FlyingCar implements Drivable, Flyable {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("Driving on the road...");
  }

  fly(): void {
    console.log("Flying in the sky...");
  }
}

const vehicle = new FlyingCar();
vehicle.drive(); // Outputs: Driving on the road...
vehicle.fly();   // Outputs: Flying in the sky...
```

Here, the `FlyingCar` class implements both the `Drivable` and `Flyable` interfaces, ensuring it can both drive and fly by fulfilling both contracts.

## 5.2.3 Interfaces and Classes Working Together

Interfaces can work alongside classes to provide additional structure and flexibility. For instance, a class can implement an interface while adding its own unique properties or methods beyond what the interface requires.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
  makeSound(): void;
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  name: string;
  breed: string;

  constructor(name: string, breed: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog("Rex", "Golden Retriever");
console.log(myDog.name);    // Outputs: Rex
console.log(myDog.breed);   // Outputs: Golden Retriever
myDog.makeSound();          // Outputs: Woof!
```

In this case, the `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface, ensuring it has a `name` and `makeSound()` method, while also adding an additional property, `breed`.

## 5.2.4 Enforcing Methods with Interfaces

Interfaces are often used to enforce specific methods on classes. When a class implements an interface, it must include all the methods defined by that interface, helping to ensure that certain behaviors are implemented.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Logger {
  log(message: string): void;
}

class ConsoleLogger implements Logger {
  log(message: string): void {
    console.log(`Log message: ${message}`);
  }
}

const logger = new ConsoleLogger();
logger.log("Hello, world!"); // Outputs: Log message: Hello, world!
```

Here, the `ConsoleLogger` class implements the `Logger` interface, ensuring it has a `log()` method that takes a string and outputs it to the console.

## 5.2.5 Optional Properties and Methods in Interfaces

Just like with object types, interfaces can have optional properties or methods. Classes implementing these interfaces can choose to provide them, but it's not mandatory.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Device {
  name: string;
  turnOn(): void;
  turnOff?(): void; // Optional method
}

class Computer implements Device {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  turnOn(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} is now on.`);
  }

  // Optional turnOff method is not implemented
}

const myComputer = new Computer("Laptop");
myComputer.turnOn(); // Outputs: Laptop is now on.
```

In this example, the `Device` interface defines an optional `turnOff()` method. The `Computer` class implements the interface but only provides the `turnOn()` method, which is perfectly valid.

## 5.2.6 Interface Inheritance in Implementation

A class can implement interfaces that extend other interfaces, inheriting properties and methods from multiple sources.

### Example:
```typescript
interface Shape {
  color: string;
}

interface Movable {
  move(): void;
}

interface Drawable extends Shape, Movable {
  draw(): void;
}

class Circle implements Drawable {
  color: string;

  constructor(color: string) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  move(): void {
    console.log("Circle is moving...");
  }

  draw(): void {
    console.log(`Drawing a ${this.color} circle.`);
  }
}

const myCircle = new Circle("red");
myCircle.move();  // Outputs: Circle is moving...
myCircle.draw();  // Outputs: Drawing a red circle.
```

Here, the `Drawable` interface extends both `Shape` and `Movable`, and the `Circle` class implements `Drawable`, inheriting the requirements from both parent interfaces.

## 5.2.7 Key Points

- **Implementation**: Classes use the `implements` keyword to adhere to an interface's contract, ensuring they provide all the properties and methods defined.
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Classes can implement multiple interfaces, making them flexible and adaptable to various contracts.
- **Optional Members**: Interfaces can have optional properties and methods, giving implementing classes more flexibility.
- **Interface Inheritance**: Interfaces can extend other interfaces, and classes can implement interfaces that inherit from multiple sources, ensuring complex types are handled effectively.

Implementing interfaces ensures that your TypeScript code is well-structured, type-safe, and that objects and classes consistently follow the expected design.
