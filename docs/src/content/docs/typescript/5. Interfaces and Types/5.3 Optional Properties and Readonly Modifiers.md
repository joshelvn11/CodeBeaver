title: 5.3 Optional Properties and Readonly Modifiers
---

In TypeScript, interfaces can have optional properties and readonly modifiers. These features give developers more control over how objects are structured and used, making the codebase safer and more flexible. Optional properties allow flexibility, while readonly modifiers ensure data integrity by preventing unwanted changes.

## 5.3.1 What are Optional Properties?

Optional properties in TypeScript interfaces are properties that might not be present in every object of that type. You can mark a property as optional by adding a question mark (`?`) after the property name.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
interface InterfaceName {
  propertyName?: Type;
}
```

#### Example:
```typescript
interface User {
  username: string;
  email?: string;  // Optional property
}

const user1: User = { username: "john_doe" };
const user2: User = { username: "jane_doe", email: "jane@example.com" };

console.log(user1.username);  // Outputs: john_doe
console.log(user2.email);     // Outputs: jane@example.com
```

In this example, `email` is an optional property. The `user1` object does not include an `email`, while `user2` does. TypeScript allows both cases without errors.

## 5.3.2 Use Cases for Optional Properties

Optional properties are useful when not every object requires all properties to be defined. This is especially common when working with APIs or configurations where some fields may not always be necessary.

#### Example:
```typescript
interface Config {
  apiKey?: string;
  timeout: number;
}

function initializeApp(config: Config) {
  if (config.apiKey) {
    console.log("Using API Key:", config.apiKey);
  }
  console.log("Timeout is set to:", config.timeout);
}

initializeApp({ timeout: 5000 });  // Works without apiKey
initializeApp({ apiKey: "12345", timeout: 5000 });  // Also valid
```

Here, `apiKey` is an optional property in the `Config` interface, so itâ€™s acceptable to call `initializeApp()` with or without it.

## 5.3.3 What is a Readonly Modifier?

The `readonly` modifier in TypeScript ensures that a property cannot be changed after it has been initialized. This is helpful for defining constants or protecting certain data from being accidentally modified.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
interface InterfaceName {
  readonly propertyName: Type;
}
```

#### Example:
```typescript
interface Car {
  readonly model: string;
  year: number;
}

const myCar: Car = { model: "Toyota Corolla", year: 2021 };
console.log(myCar.model);  // Outputs: Toyota Corolla

myCar.year = 2022;         // This works
// myCar.model = "Honda Civic"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'model' because it is a read-only property.
```

In this example, the `model` property is marked as `readonly`. Once assigned, it cannot be changed, ensuring that the `model` value remains constant.

## 5.3.4 Use Cases for Readonly Modifiers

Readonly properties are especially useful when you need to create immutable data structures or protect certain fields from being updated unintentionally. This is common in scenarios such as database records or configuration objects.

#### Example:
```typescript
interface Product {
  readonly id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

const product: Product = { id: 101, name: "Laptop", price: 999 };
console.log(product.id);   // Outputs: 101

product.name = "Gaming Laptop";   // This is allowed
// product.id = 102;             // Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
```

Here, the `id` is marked as `readonly`, so it remains immutable, ensuring that once a product is created with a specific ID, it cannot be altered.

## 5.3.5 Combining Optional and Readonly Properties

It is possible to combine both `optional` and `readonly` properties in a single interface. This allows for even greater flexibility in defining object structures.

#### Example:
```typescript
interface Book {
  readonly title: string;
  author?: string;  // Optional property
}

const book1: Book = { title: "1984" };
const book2: Book = { title: "Brave New World", author: "Aldous Huxley" };

console.log(book1.title);  // Outputs: 1984
// book1.title = "Animal Farm";  // Error: Cannot assign to 'title' because it is a read-only property.

if (book2.author) {
  console.log(book2.author);  // Outputs: Aldous Huxley
}
```

In this example, `title` is a `readonly` property, and `author` is optional. The `book1` object is created without an author, while `book2` includes both the title and author.

## 5.3.6 Key Points

- **Optional Properties (`?`)**: Allow properties to be optional, making the interface more flexible by allowing objects with missing properties.
- **Readonly Modifier**: Ensures that a property can only be assigned once, protecting it from modification after initial assignment.
- **Use Cases**: Optional properties are useful in configurations or optional fields in objects, while readonly properties are ideal for constants and immutable data.
- **Combining Features**: You can combine both optional and readonly properties in a single interface, providing flexibility while enforcing immutability where needed.

By leveraging optional properties and readonly modifiers, TypeScript allows you to build more robust and flexible object structures, ensuring type safety while giving you control over how objects are used and modified.
