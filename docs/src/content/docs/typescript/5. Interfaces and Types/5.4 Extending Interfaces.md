title: 5.4 Extending Interfaces
---

In TypeScript, extending interfaces allows you to create more complex and reusable interfaces by combining existing ones. This feature promotes code reusability and enables you to build on top of previously defined structures without duplicating code.

## 5.4.1 What is Interface Extension?

Extending an interface in TypeScript means creating a new interface that inherits properties from one or more existing interfaces. This is similar to inheritance in object-oriented programming and provides flexibility when working with complex data structures.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
interface ParentInterface {
  property1: Type;
}

interface ChildInterface extends ParentInterface {
  property2: Type;
}
```

In this example, `ChildInterface` extends `ParentInterface`, meaning it will have both `property1` and `property2`.

#### Example:
```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

const myDog: Dog = {
  name: "Buddy",
  breed: "Golden Retriever",
};

console.log(myDog.name);  // Outputs: Buddy
console.log(myDog.breed); // Outputs: Golden Retriever
```

Here, `Dog` extends `Animal`, so it inherits the `name` property from `Animal` and adds a new property `breed`.

## 5.4.2 Extending Multiple Interfaces

TypeScript also supports extending multiple interfaces. This means you can create an interface that combines properties from two or more interfaces.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
interface Interface1 {
  property1: Type;
}

interface Interface2 {
  property2: Type;
}

interface CombinedInterface extends Interface1, Interface2 {
  property3: Type;
}
```

#### Example:
```typescript
interface Vehicle {
  wheels: number;
}

interface Engine {
  horsepower: number;
}

interface Car extends Vehicle, Engine {
  brand: string;
}

const myCar: Car = {
  wheels: 4,
  horsepower: 300,
  brand: "Toyota",
};

console.log(myCar.wheels);     // Outputs: 4
console.log(myCar.horsepower); // Outputs: 300
console.log(myCar.brand);      // Outputs: Toyota
```

In this example, the `Car` interface extends both `Vehicle` and `Engine`, so it includes properties from both interfaces and adds its own `brand` property.

## 5.4.3 Benefits of Extending Interfaces

### 1. **Code Reusability**: 
   Interface extension helps you avoid repeating common properties across different interfaces, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

### 2. **Flexible Object Design**: 
   By extending interfaces, you can create more specific object types that build on general ones. This allows for hierarchical structures that mirror real-world relationships, like a `Dog` extending `Animal`.

### 3. **Combining Multiple Structures**: 
   With multiple interface extensions, you can combine properties from different interfaces into one, allowing for a more comprehensive type definition.

## 5.4.4 Extending Interfaces with Optional and Readonly Properties

You can also extend interfaces that include optional or readonly properties. This ensures that any object implementing the extended interface will respect the original interface's rules regarding those properties.

#### Example:
```typescript
interface User {
  readonly id: number;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
}

interface Admin extends User {
  adminLevel: number;
}

const adminUser: Admin = {
  id: 101,
  name: "Alice",
  adminLevel: 2,
};

console.log(adminUser.id);       // Outputs: 101
console.log(adminUser.name);     // Outputs: Alice
console.log(adminUser.adminLevel); // Outputs: 2

// adminUser.id = 102;  // Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property
```

In this example, `Admin` extends `User`, which includes both optional (`email`) and readonly (`id`) properties. The `Admin` interface inherits those rules, so `id` remains readonly in the `adminUser` object.

## 5.4.5 Interface Extension vs. Intersection Types

Though both interface extension and intersection types allow you to combine properties from multiple types, there are subtle differences:

- **Extending interfaces**: This approach allows for more semantic relationships, particularly in hierarchical object design. You can create more specific versions of a broader type.
- **Intersection types**: These combine multiple types into one but without the notion of inheritance. Intersection types are more suited for creating a type that needs to satisfy multiple contracts.

#### Example of Intersection Types:
```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Employee {
  employeeId: number;
}

type StaffMember = Person & Employee;

const staff: StaffMember = {
  name: "John",
  employeeId: 1234,
};

console.log(staff.name);       // Outputs: John
console.log(staff.employeeId); // Outputs: 1234
```

In this example, `StaffMember` is a combination of `Person` and `Employee` using an intersection type, but thereâ€™s no inheritance involved.

## 5.4.6 Key Points

- **Interface Extension**: Allows you to create new interfaces based on existing ones, enabling reuse and flexible object design.
- **Extending Multiple Interfaces**: You can extend more than one interface, combining properties from multiple sources.
- **Optional and Readonly Properties**: When extending interfaces with these properties, the new interface inherits the original interface's constraints.
- **Use Cases**: Interface extension is ideal for building hierarchical structures (e.g., `Car` extends `Vehicle`) or when multiple interfaces need to be combined into a single type.

By extending interfaces, you can write cleaner, more maintainable TypeScript code that models complex types while avoiding redundancy. This makes it easier to manage changes as your application grows in complexity.
