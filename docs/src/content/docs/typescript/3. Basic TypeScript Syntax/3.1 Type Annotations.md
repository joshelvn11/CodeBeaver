title: 3.1 Type Annotations
---

Type annotations in TypeScript allow developers to explicitly declare the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. By defining types, TypeScript helps catch errors during development, improving code quality and readability.

**Key Features**

- **Type Safety**: Helps prevent common errors by enforcing type checks.
- **Improved Readability**: Clear type declarations make the code easier to understand.
- **Error Prevention**: Detects type-related errors early, before runtime.

### 3.1.1 Basic Types

#### Number, String, and Boolean

TypeScript provides basic types such as `number`, `string`, and `boolean` to handle numbers, text, and true/false values, respectively.

```typescript
let age: number = 25;
let firstName: string = 'John';
let isStudent: boolean = true;
```

In this example:
- `age` is a number.
- `firstName` is a string.
- `isStudent` is a boolean.

### 3.1.2 Arrays

TypeScript allows arrays to hold values of a specified type. You can define an array by adding square brackets `[]` after the type.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let names: string[] = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
```

Here, `numbers` is an array of numbers, and `names` is an array of strings.

### 3.1.3 Tuples

Tuples are used to store fixed-size arrays with known types for each index. They are useful when you need to represent a collection of values where each value has a different type.

```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ['Alice', 30];
```

In this example, `person` is a tuple where the first element is a string (`'Alice'`) and the second is a number (`30`).

### 3.1.4 Type Inference

TypeScript can automatically infer the type of a variable based on its value, so you don't always need to specify the type.

```typescript
let inferredName = 'John'; // TypeScript infers this as a string
```

Even though no explicit type is given, TypeScript infers the type of `inferredName` as `string`.

### 3.1.5 Union Types

Union types allow a variable to hold more than one type by combining them with a `|` (pipe) symbol.

```typescript
let id: number | string = 123;
id = 'ABC'; // Both numbers and strings are allowed
```

Here, `id` can be either a number or a string.

### 3.1.6 Type Aliases

You can create custom type aliases to make complex types easier to reuse.

```typescript
type ID = number | string;
let userId: ID = 101;
let orderId: ID = 'A123';
```

In this example, `ID` is a type alias representing either a number or a string, which is used for `userId` and `orderId`.

### 3.1.7 Example: Function with Type Annotations

Here's a simple function that uses type annotations for its parameters and return type:

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}

let result: number = add(5, 10);
```

In this example, both `a` and `b` are annotated as `number`, and the function is declared to return a `number`.

By using type annotations in TypeScript, you can write more reliable, maintainable, and self-documenting code.
