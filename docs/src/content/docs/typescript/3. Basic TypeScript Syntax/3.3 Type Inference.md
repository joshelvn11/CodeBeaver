title: 3.3 Type Inference
---

Type inference in TypeScript is a feature that allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable or expression without explicitly declaring it. This makes the code more concise while still maintaining type safety.

**Key Features:**

- **Automatic Typing**: TypeScript infers types based on assigned values or operations.
- **Contextual Typing**: Inference occurs from surrounding context, like function parameters and return values.
- **Gradual Typing**: You can combine inferred types with explicit types for more control.

### 1.1 Benefits of Type Inference

1. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Less need to explicitly define types, especially for simple values.
2. **Improved Readability**: Code remains concise without sacrificing clarity.
3. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent typing throughout your code without needing to manually track every type.

## 2. Type Inference in Variables

When you assign a value to a variable without explicitly declaring its type, TypeScript infers its type based on the value assigned.

### 2.1 Simple Variable Inference

```typescript
let name = "Alice";  // Inferred as string
let age = 30;        // Inferred as number
let isStudent = true; // Inferred as boolean
```

In this example, TypeScript automatically infers the types as `string`, `number`, and `boolean`, respectively.

### 2.2 Array Inference

When declaring an array, TypeScript will infer the type based on the values inside the array.

```typescript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];    // Inferred as number[]
let names = ["Alice", "Bob"]; // Inferred as string[]
```

Here, `numbers` is inferred as an array of numbers (`number[]`) and `names` as an array of strings (`string[]`).

## 3. Type Inference in Functions

Type inference also works in functions, where TypeScript infers the types of the return values and parameters if not explicitly defined.

### 3.1 Inferring Return Types

When you define a function and don't specify its return type, TypeScript infers it from the return statement.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;  // Inferred as number
}
```

Since the function `add` returns the sum of two numbers, TypeScript infers the return type as `number`.

### 3.2 Inferring Parameter Types

In some cases, TypeScript can infer the types of function parameters based on how they are used in the function body.

```typescript
function greet(person = "World") {
  return `Hello, ${person}`;  // Inferred as string
}
```

Here, the `person` parameter is inferred as a `string` because it is initialized with the string `"World"`.

## 4. Contextual Typing

TypeScript can infer types based on the surrounding context, such as event handlers, callbacks, or function arguments.

### 4.1 Example of Contextual Typing

```typescript
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button?.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log(event.clientX);  // Inferred as MouseEvent
});
```

In this case, TypeScript infers that `event` is of type `MouseEvent` because the `click` event is tied to a DOM element.

## 5. Best Practices for Type Inference

While TypeScript’s type inference can greatly reduce the amount of code you need to write, it's important to follow some best practices to ensure your code remains clean and easy to understand.

### 5.1 Use Explicit Types for Complex Objects

For complex objects or APIs, it's better to use explicit types to avoid potential issues and make the code more maintainable.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

let user: User = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };  // Explicit type declaration
```

### 5.2 Rely on Inference for Simple Cases

In cases where the type is obvious, such as simple variables or return types, you can rely on TypeScript to infer the type.

```typescript
let count = 10; // Inferred as number
const greeting = "Hello"; // Inferred as string
```

### 5.3 Combine Inference with Explicit Types

You can combine type inference and explicit types to maintain flexibility in your code, especially in functions or more complex objects.

```typescript
function multiply(a: number, b: number) {
  return a * b;  // Inferred as number
}
```

## 6. Advanced Type Inference

TypeScript can infer types in more complex scenarios, including when dealing with generics, union types, and conditional types.

### 6.1 Generics and Type Inference

When using generics, TypeScript can infer the type argument based on the function’s usage.

```typescript
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;  // Inferred based on usage
}

let num = identity(42);  // T inferred as number
let str = identity("Hello");  // T inferred as string
```

### 6.2 Union Types

TypeScript can also infer types when using union types, which allows for multiple possible types.

```typescript
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());  // Inferred as string
  } else {
    console.log(id.toFixed(2));  // Inferred as number
  }
}
```

## 7. Conclusion

Type inference in TypeScript is a powerful feature that enhances code readability and reduces the need for excessive type annotations. While it's a great tool to streamline code, knowing when to rely on inference and when to use explicit types is essential to writing maintainable, scalable applications.
