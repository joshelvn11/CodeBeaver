title: 3.5 Type Aliases
---

Type aliases in TypeScript allow you to create custom names for types, making your code more readable and maintainable. They are especially useful for defining complex types or simplifying repetitive type declarations. By using type aliases, you can assign a name to a type and then reuse that name throughout your code.

### 3.5.1 What is a Type Alias?

A type alias is a way to create a new name for any type, including primitive types, object types, union types, or even more complex types like functions or arrays. You define a type alias using the `type` keyword.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
type AliasName = <type_definition>;
```

#### Example:
```typescript
type ID = string | number;

let userId: ID;
userId = "abc123";  // Valid
userId = 42;        // Valid
```

In this example, `ID` is a type alias that can be either a `string` or a `number`. You can then use `ID` wherever you need a union of these types.

### 3.5.2 Why Use Type Aliases?

Type aliases improve the clarity of your code by giving descriptive names to complex types. They can also reduce redundancy, making your code easier to refactor. Instead of repeating the same type definition in multiple places, you define it once and refer to it by name.

#### Benefits:
- **Readability**: Improves the self-documenting nature of the code.
- **Reusability**: Allows you to reuse type definitions across your codebase.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies updates when changes are needed.

### 3.5.3 Basic Example of a Type Alias

Here’s a simple example using a type alias to represent an object structure:

```typescript
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

let newUser: User = {
  id: "u1",
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30
};
```

In this example, `User` is a type alias for an object with `id`, `name`, and `age` properties. This alias can be used to create new variables or function parameters that require this specific structure.

### 3.5.4 Type Aliases with Union Types

Type aliases work well with union types, allowing you to combine multiple types under one name. This is useful when a variable can be of more than one type.

#### Example:
```typescript
type Status = "success" | "error" | "loading";

function updateStatus(status: Status) {
  console.log("The current status is:", status);
}

updateStatus("success");  // Valid
updateStatus("error");    // Valid
updateStatus("completed");  // Error: Argument of type '"completed"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Status'.
```

Here, `Status` is a type alias for a union of three string literals. The function `updateStatus` accepts only those specific strings as valid inputs.

### 3.5.5 Type Aliases with Function Types

You can also use type aliases to define the structure of a function, making it easier to enforce consistent function signatures.

#### Example:
```typescript
type MathOperation = (a: number, b: number) => number;

const add: MathOperation = (x, y) => x + y;
const subtract: MathOperation = (x, y) => x - y;

console.log(add(10, 5));      // Outputs: 15
console.log(subtract(10, 5)); // Outputs: 5
```

In this example, `MathOperation` is a type alias for a function that takes two numbers and returns a number. The `add` and `subtract` functions follow this signature.

### 3.5.6 Type Aliases with Arrays and Tuples

Type aliases are also useful for arrays and tuples, especially when dealing with complex data structures.

#### Example with Arrays:
```typescript
type StringArray = string[];

let names: StringArray = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
```

#### Example with Tuples:
```typescript
type Point = [number, number];

let coordinate: Point = [10, 20];
```

In these examples, `StringArray` is an alias for an array of strings, and `Point` is an alias for a tuple containing two numbers.

### 3.5.7 Type Aliases vs Interfaces

Both type aliases and interfaces can define object shapes, but there are some differences:
- **Type Aliases**: Can represent any type (primitives, unions, functions, etc.).
- **Interfaces**: Are primarily used for object types and can be extended or implemented by classes.

#### Example:
```typescript
type Car = {
  brand: string;
  model: string;
};

interface Vehicle {
  brand: string;
  model: string;
}

let car1: Car = { brand: "Toyota", model: "Corolla" };
let car2: Vehicle = { brand: "Honda", model: "Civic" };
```

In this case, both `Car` (a type alias) and `Vehicle` (an interface) define the same structure, but interfaces have additional features like merging and inheritance.

### 3.5.8 Key Points

- **Type Aliases**: Provide a way to define custom names for any type, making your code more readable and maintainable.
- **Complex Types**: Aliases can simplify complex types such as unions, function signatures, and tuples.
- **Reusability**: You can reuse the same type alias in multiple places, reducing code duplication.
- **Interfaces vs Type Aliases**: While both can define object types, type aliases can also handle unions, functions, and more.

By mastering type aliases, you can write cleaner, more flexible TypeScript code that’s easy to read and maintain.
