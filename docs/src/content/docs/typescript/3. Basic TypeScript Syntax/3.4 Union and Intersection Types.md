title: 3.4 Union and Intersection Types
---

Union and Intersection types are essential features in TypeScript that allow you to create complex type combinations. They give you flexibility when defining types, making your code more expressive and adaptable.

### 3.4.1 What is a Union Type?

A Union type allows a value to be one of several types. You use the pipe (`|`) symbol to create a union type, meaning that a variable can hold a value of either type listed in the union.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
let value: string | number;
```
Here, `value` can be either a `string` or a `number`.

#### Example:
```typescript
function formatInput(input: string | number) {
  if (typeof input === "string") {
    return input.toUpperCase();
  }
  return input.toFixed(2);
}

console.log(formatInput("Hello"));  // Outputs: HELLO
console.log(formatInput(3.14159));  // Outputs: 3.14
```

In this example, the function `formatInput` accepts an argument that can be either a string or a number, and it handles both cases accordingly.

### 3.4.2 What is an Intersection Type?

An Intersection type combines multiple types into one. You use the ampersand (`&`) symbol to create an intersection type, meaning that a variable must satisfy all the types listed in the intersection.

**Syntax:**
```typescript
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { id: number };

let employee: Person & Employee;
```
In this case, `employee` must have both the `name` and `id` properties.

#### Example:
```typescript
type Developer = { name: string, code: () => void };
type Manager = { name: string, manage: () => void };

type DevManager = Developer & Manager;

const devManager: DevManager = {
  name: "Alice",
  code: () => console.log("Coding..."),
  manage: () => console.log("Managing...")
};

devManager.code();   // Outputs: Coding...
devManager.manage(); // Outputs: Managing...
```

Here, `devManager` must have properties and methods from both `Developer` and `Manager`, ensuring that it can both code and manage.

### 3.4.3 When to Use Union Types

Union types are useful when a value can be of different types but not at the same time. They are ideal for handling different possible input types in functions or API responses.

#### Example:
```typescript
function processInput(input: string | boolean) {
  if (typeof input === "string") {
    console.log("Processing string:", input);
  } else {
    console.log("Processing boolean:", input ? "True" : "False");
  }
}
```

In this example, `processInput` handles both `string` and `boolean` inputs, allowing the function to accommodate more flexibility in the types it accepts.

### 3.4.4 When to Use Intersection Types

Intersection types are useful when you need to combine multiple types into a single type, and the resulting type must include all the properties from the intersecting types. This is especially helpful when modeling objects that need to satisfy multiple contracts.

#### Example:
```typescript
type Admin = { adminLevel: number };
type User = { username: string };

type AdminUser = Admin & User;

let adminUser: AdminUser = {
  adminLevel: 3,
  username: "AdminUser123"
};
```

In this case, `adminUser` must have properties from both `Admin` and `User`.

### 3.4.5 Combining Union and Intersection Types

Sometimes, you may need to use both union and intersection types in complex scenarios. For example, when a value must satisfy multiple requirements but also have flexibility in certain fields.

#### Example:
```typescript
type Car = { wheels: number };
type Boat = { sails: number };
type AmphibiousVehicle = (Car & Boat) | Car;

let vehicle1: AmphibiousVehicle = { wheels: 4, sails: 2 };  // Valid (Amphibious)
let vehicle2: AmphibiousVehicle = { wheels: 4 };            // Valid (Car)
```

Here, `AmphibiousVehicle` can be either a combination of `Car` and `Boat` or just a `Car`. This shows how union and intersection types work together to create more flexible and descriptive type definitions.

### 3.4.6 Key Points

- **Union Types (`|`)**: Allow a value to be one of multiple types.
- **Intersection Types (`&`)**: Combine multiple types into one, requiring the value to satisfy all the types.
- **Use Cases**: Use union types when handling multiple possible types in different situations. Use intersection types when combining properties or methods from multiple types into one.

By leveraging Union and Intersection types, TypeScript offers powerful tools for more precise and flexible type checking, ensuring your code is both robust and easy to maintain.
