title: 3.2 Enums
---

Enums are a special feature in TypeScript that allow you to define a set of named constants. This can help make your code more readable and manageable by grouping related constants together.

### 3.2.1 What are Enums?

Enums (short for "enumerations") represent a way to define a set of named values that a variable can hold. These are especially useful when you have a set of fixed values that you want to group under a single type. TypeScript supports two types of enums:

1. **Numeric Enums**: Enums where values are automatically assigned numbers.
2. **String Enums**: Enums where values are explicitly assigned strings.

### 3.2.2 Defining Enums

#### 3.2.2.1 Numeric Enums

Numeric enums are the most basic type of enum. They start numbering from `0` by default and increment automatically.

```typescript
enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
}

let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
console.log(move); // Output: 0
```

In this example, `Up` is assigned `0`, `Down` becomes `1`, `Left` becomes `2`, and so on.

#### 3.2.2.2 String Enums

String enums allow you to explicitly assign string values to enum members. These are useful when you want more meaningful values for your enum.

```typescript
enum Direction {
    Up = "UP",
    Down = "DOWN",
    Left = "LEFT",
    Right = "RIGHT"
}

let move: Direction = Direction.Up;
console.log(move); // Output: "UP"
```

Here, each direction is assigned a descriptive string value.

### 3.2.3 Why Use Enums?

Enums provide several key benefits:
- **Readability**: Enums make your code easier to read by providing descriptive names for values.
- **Refactoring**: Changes are easier to make since you modify the enum in one place.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript checks the values assigned to enum-typed variables, reducing potential bugs.

### 3.2.4 Accessing Enums

Enums in TypeScript are bi-directional, meaning you can access the name by its value and vice versa.

#### 3.2.4.1 Numeric Enums

```typescript
enum Status {
    Active,
    Inactive,
    Pending
}

console.log(Status.Active); // Output: 0
console.log(Status[0]); // Output: "Active"
```

You can retrieve the enum name using the numeric value. This doesn’t work with string enums, as they are not reverse-mapped.

### 3.2.5 Heterogeneous Enums

TypeScript also supports enums that mix numeric and string values, although this is generally less common and should be used cautiously.

```typescript
enum MixedEnum {
    Yes = 1,
    No = "NO"
}

console.log(MixedEnum.Yes); // Output: 1
console.log(MixedEnum.No);  // Output: "NO"
```

### 3.2.6 Const Enums

To optimize performance, you can define **const enums**. These are removed during compilation, and the enum members are inlined wherever they are used, reducing the output size of your code.

```typescript
const enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}

let myColor = Color.Green;
console.log(myColor); // Output: 1
```

With `const enum`, no object is generated for the enum at runtime; only the values are inlined.

### 3.2.7 Enum Example

Here's an example that demonstrates how enums can be used in a simple application:

```typescript
enum LogLevel {
    Info,
    Warning,
    Error
}

function logMessage(level: LogLevel, message: string) {
    switch (level) {
        case LogLevel.Info:
            console.log(`Info: ${message}`);
            break;
        case LogLevel.Warning:
            console.warn(`Warning: ${message}`);
            break;
        case LogLevel.Error:
            console.error(`Error: ${message}`);
            break;
    }
}

logMessage(LogLevel.Warning, "This is a warning message.");
```

In this example, the `LogLevel` enum is used to define the severity of log messages. It helps avoid magic numbers or strings in the code, making it more readable and maintainable.

### 3.2.8 Best Practices for Enums

- **Use String Enums for Readability**: If the actual values matter (e.g., in logs, or when interacting with APIs), use string enums.
- **Avoid Overusing Heterogeneous Enums**: Mixing string and numeric values can lead to confusion and should generally be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
- **Use `const` Enums When Possible**: This can improve performance, but remember that `const` enums don’t support reverse mapping.

By understanding enums in TypeScript, you can write more structured and readable code, improving maintainability and reducing errors.
